# Homeless Help
---
In February 2018, there were approximately 3,605 homeless people in Houston. Homelessness has become a huge issue recently, especially in areas where gentrification is extremely relevant. Here in Houston, approximately 1 in every 430 people are homeless compared to 1 in every 135 people in Denver, and 1 in every 126 people in San Francisco. So while Houston is doing a great job with the homelessness problem, there is still room for improvement.

The problem in cities like San Francisco and New York is the price for building affordable housing. The average price per square foot in San Francisco is $1,185, and $1,773 for New York City, while Houston sits at a measly $161. And not only does Houston have the advantage of cost, but area too. NYC's area sits just above 300 square miles, San Francisco is only 47 square miles while Houston trumps both cities at 627 square miles. So with housing 10x less expensive than New York City, and having 13x more space than San Francisco, building affordable shouldn't be as much of a problem.

According to The Atlantic, the greatest reason people stay homeless is because it doesn't allow them to develop a sense of 'permanency' as permanency allows people to get the help they need to find jobs and get sober. And while emergency shelters help provide many people a roof over their head and place to sleep, they are far more expensive compared to vouchers for permanent housing ($4,819/month compared to $1,162/month).

The solution seems to point to not only providing affordable housing but giving resources to help the homeless as well. That's why I created Homeless Help, to help homeless people find affordable housing, as well as provid them the resources to get out of homelessness.

But our efforts shouldn't stop just at building affordable housing. Along with this 'housing-first'

The overall problem is over time, costs for these programs are increasing, yet the funding have remained approximately constant.
